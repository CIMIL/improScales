# improScales

ImproScales is a Web Audio application devised to support musicians in the process of learning to use scales during improvisation. The web application detects in real-time the notes played by an individual instrument and assesses whether they belong to the scale, and as a result provides statistics about the number of errors made. Two use cases were implemented following a design process conducted with interviews with musicians: i) scale practicing with the sole instrument and ii) scale practicing with accompanying music retrieved from YouTube. The first use case is primarily intended for those musicians who do not know well the musical scales and want to learn them properly, or for those who want to practice without a backing track, while the second is meant for people who already know the scales and want to improvise over a song or instrumental music.
